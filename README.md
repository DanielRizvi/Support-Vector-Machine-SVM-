# Support Vector Machine SVM #CodeDaniel
This project provides an implementation of support vector machine (SVM) and maximum margin classifiers, which are powerful tools for binary classification tasks. These classifiers aim to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes, thereby achieving good generalization performance.

The implementation includes the following features:

Training and prediction functions for both SVM and maximum margin classifiers
Support for linear, polynomial, and kernels for SVM
Support for binary and multiclass classification tasks
Visualization functions for the decision boundary and support vectors
The implementation is based on the Python scikit-learn library, which provides efficient and flexible tools for machine learning tasks. The project also includes example scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of the classifiers on various datasets.

To use the implementation, simply clone the GitHub repository and run the example scripts or modify them for your own datasets. The code is fully documented and easy to understand, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning practitioners.

Whether you're new to SVM and maximum margin classifiers or looking for a flexible and customizable implementation, this project has everything you need to get started.
